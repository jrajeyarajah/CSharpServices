I work with IIS, SQL Server, MySQL. I don’t want them running all the time and slowing down my computer. So, I turn them on and off as required. Starting up the “Services.mcs” and finding the services and turning them on and off seem too long winded so I wrote this program. 

The name of the services I am interested are kept in the service.ini file.

**services.ini** has to be with the executable file when running
